            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey! I'm Han Wang, I am a cogs major at UCSD, in my 3rd year. I am in the design and interaction track, and it's been pretty cool! I have taken courses where we learn web things, some basic data analysis skills, etc. It's actually kind of fun trying to figure out how to make websites/applications that are not super frustrating to use.</p>

            <p>I guess I am making this portfolio for the purpose of internships or graduate study; those are all a type of résumé after all. While a résumé is enough, it is only some experiences in the past. A portfolio can show what has actually been done. For a master's program or internship application, some teaching assistants and company leaders would still like to see a portfolio. So I need to prepare one yet. It would also be easier to explain things while pointing to the portfolio.</p>

                            <p>This was my first time using an API so I learned how to actually grab data and display it on the page. Tried to get it working on mobile too which was a pain at first but I figured it out.</p>

                            <p>I did this in collaboration with another person in my class. We divided up the work and did code reviews on each other's work. I became much more comfortable with reading documentation when I hit a road block, which, unfortunately, happens often.</p>

            <h2>What Makes a Good Portfolio?</h2>
            <p>From in-class lectures and browsing other people's portfolios, I have picked up on a few trends. The most important one is that you want to actually display your work. It is not enough to say that you did something. If you created a website, for example, you should provide it so others can see what you can do.</p>

            <p>You also want to choose projects relevant to what you are applying for. If it's a design internship, put design projects. If it's a more code heavy internship, then lean that way. In other words, don't just include every random thing you've done. And its useful to explain how you created the project or what you learned, not just what the final product looks like.</p>

            <p>I suppose the other thing is to keep it relevant and just think about what the company/program is actually looking for. You don't have to put everything you've ever made in here, just what is appropriate to what you are going for.</p>
